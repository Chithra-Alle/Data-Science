# Joins  üõ©Ô∏èüõ©Ô∏è
Combining 2 or more tables is known as joins

## Types of Joins
### Inner Join 
  It gives the matching columns from both the tables
### Outer Join
- Left Outer Join / Left Join
   It gives all records from left table and matchin records from right table
- Right outer Join / Right Join
   It gives all records from right table and matchin records from left table
- Full outer Join / Full Join
   A FULL OUTER JOIN returns all records from both tables, combining matching records and filling unmatched ones with NULL.
### Cross Join
   A CROSS JOIN creates a Cartesian product, returning all possible combinations of rows from both tables.
### Self Join
   A SELF JOIN is a join where a table is joined with itself, treating it as two separate tables using aliases.

| 4     | 65         |
