Having : To filter the data

Order by : Arranging the data by asc, desc
# ORDER BY should always appear after SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING.
SELECT movie_name, rating FROM movies WHERE rating > 7 ORDER BY rating DESC;

# You can sort by multiple columns. The sorting will happen in order of priority.
SELECT movie_name, director, rating FROM movies ORDER BY rating DESC, director ASC;
if rating is same then looks at second priority, otherwise it ignores second condition

# Instead of column names, you can use their position number in SELECT.
SELECT movie_name, rating FROM movies ORDER BY 2 DESC;  -- Sorts by the second column (rating) in descending order
